Ex. 1.2.1 Suppose that a and b are int variables. What does the following
          sequence of statements do?
        int t = a; b = t; a = b;
   Set everything a, b, t to the original value of a.


Ex. 1.2.3 Suppose that a and b are boolean variables. Show that the expression
    (!(a && b) && (a || b)) || ((a && b) || !(a || b))
   evaluates to true.
   (!(a && b) && (a || b)) || ((a && b) || !(a || b))
   ( t/f && (a || b)) || ((a && b) || !(a || b))
   ( t/f && t/f) || ((a && b) || !(a || b))
   t/f || ((a && b) || !(a || b))
   t/f || ((a && b) || !(a || b))

Ex. 1.2.4 Suppose that a and b are int variables. Simplify the following
          expression: (!(a < b) && !(a > b)).
      Ans: (a == b).

Ex. 1.2.5 The exclusive or operator ^ for boolean operands is defined to be
          true if they are different, false if they are the same.
          Give a truth table for this function.
     Ans: T ^ T => F
          T ^ F => T
          F ^ T => T
          F ^ F => F

Ex. 1.2.6 Why does 10/3 give 3 and not 3.333333333? 
    Ans: Both numbers are integers and the '/' operator returns another integer

Ex. 1.2.7 What does each of the following print?
 a. System.out.println(2 + "bc");     2bc
 b. System.out.println(2 + 3 + "bc"); 5bc
 c. System.out.println((2+3) + "bc"); 5bc
 d. System.out.println("bc" + (2+3)); bc5
 e. System.out.println("bc" + 2 + 3); bc23
    Ans: the integers are converted to chars then concatenated to the string

Ex. 1.2.8 Explain how to use program 1.2.3 to find the square root of a number.
    Ans: if b == a then 1.2.3 will find the square root using the quadratic
         formula.

Ex. 1.2.9  What does each of the following print?
 a. System.out.println('b');  => b
   Converts 'b' to a string then prints
 b. System.out.println('b' + 'c'); => 197
   Converts 'b' and 'c' to ints, then adds, then prints
 c. System.out.println((char) ('a' + 4)); => e
   Converts 'a' to a number, adds 4, converts to a chart, then converts to a
   string then prints.

Ex. 1.2.10
    Suppose that a variable a is declared as int a = 2147483647
    (or equivalently, Integer.MAX_VALUE). What does each of the following print?
     a. System.out.println(a);
       2147483647 print out largest integer.
     b. System.out.println(a+1);
       -2147483648 adding 1 to largest integer makes it largest negative.
     c. System.out.println(2-a);
       -2147483645 subtracting largest from 2 loops around to 2 largest negative
     d. System.out.println(-2-a);
       2147483647 minus 2 from minus 2nd largest negative creates largest positive
     e. System.out.println(2*a); -1
     f. System.out.println(4*a); -4
  Explain each outcome.

Ex. 1.2.11 Suppose that a variable a is declared as double a = 3.14159.
    What does each of the following print?
    a. System.out.println(a); => 3.14159
       Prints the double
    b. System.out.println(a+1); => 4.14159
       Converts the 1 to a double add to a then prings
    c. System.out.println(8/(int) a);  => 2
       Converts a to int (3) then divides 8/3 => 2
    d. System.out.println(8/a); => 2.5464812403910124
       Converts 8 to double then divides by 'a'
    e. System.out.println((int) (8/a)); => 2
    Explain each outcome. 

Ex. 1.2.12  Describe what happens if you write sqrt instead of Math.sqrt
    in program 1.2.3.
    Ans: Compiler error - undefined symbol

Ex. 1.2.13 Evaluate the expression (Math.sqrt(2) * Math.sqrt(2) == 2).
    Ans: false, floating point arithmetic is inexact.

Ex. 1.2.14  Write a program that takes two positive integers as command-line
            arguments and prints true if either evenly divides the other.
    
    
    See: EvenlyDivides.java

Ex. 1.2.15 Write a program that takes three positive integers as command-line
           arguments and prints false if any one of them is greater than or
           equal to the sum of the other two and true otherwise.
           (Note : This computation tests whether the three numbers could be the
            lengths of the sides of some triangle.)
    See: TriangleSides.java

Ex. 1.2.16 A physics student gets unexpected results when using the code
          double force = G * mass1 * mass2 / r * r;
       to compute values according to the formula F = Gm1m2 / r 2.
       Explain the problem and correct the code.
  Ans: Operator precedence.
       The problem is that the subexpression G*mass1*mass2 is divided by only r
       then multiplied by r: double force = (G * mass1 * mass2 / r) * r;
       The correct expression should be:
            double force = G * mass1 * mass2 / (r * r);

Ex. 1.2.17 Give the value of the variable a after the execution of each of the
           following sequences of statements:
           int a = 1;    boolean a = true;    int a = 2;
           a = a + a;    a = !a;              a = a * a;
           a = a + a;    a = !a;              a = a * a;
           a = a + a;    a = !a;              a = a * a;
    Ans:   8             false                256

Ex. 1.2.18 Write a program that takes two integer command-line arguments x and y
       and prints the Euclidean distance from the point (x, y)
       to the origin (0, 0). 
  Ans: Euclidean.java

Ex. 1.2.19 Write a program that takes two integer command-line arguments a and b
       and prints a random integer between a and b, inclusive. 
    int random = (int) (Math.random() * max) + min;
    Ans: RandInt.java

Ex. 1.2.20 Write a program that prints the sum of two random integers between
           1 and 6 (such as you might get when rolling dice). 
    Ans: RollDice.java

Ex. 1.2.21 Write a program that takes a double command-line argument t and
           prints the value of sin(2t) + sin(3t).
    Ans: SinFormula.java

Ex. 1.2.22 Write a program that takes three double command-line arguments x0,
           v0, and t and prints the value of x0 + v0*t âˆ’ g*t^2 / 2, where g is
           the constant 9.80665. (Note : This value is the displacement in
           meters after t seconds when an object is thrown straight up from
           initial position x0 at velocity v0 meters per second.)
    Ans: Velocity.java

Ex. 1.2.23 Write a program that takes two integer command-line arguments m and
           d and prints true if day d of month m is between 3/20 and 6/20,
           false otherwise.
    Ans: DayMonth.java
